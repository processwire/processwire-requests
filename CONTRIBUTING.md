# Feature Requests

Thank you for your interest in submitting a feature request to ProcessWire. We manage these 
feature requests in this separate repository so that they don't get mixed up with issue 
reports. It also enables us to maintain a collaborative team to help manage them. 

- Submit feature requests to the requests repository:
  [processwire-requests](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-requests/issues)
  
- Please note that we generally avoid adding features that aren't going to be used by at least
  30% of the ProcessWire audience. Often new features can be better accommodated with modules. 
  
- If we close your feature request, this does not mean it won't ever be implemented. It just means
  that we aren't ready to implement it just yet. Closed feature requests aren't ever deleted, so 
  consider closed feature requests to just be on the back burner. 
  
- Sometimes we will leave a feature request open for awhile to see how much interest it gains from
  others before we decide whether it should be implemented.

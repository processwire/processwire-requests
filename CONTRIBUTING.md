# Contributing to the ProcessWire requests repository

Thank you for your interest in submitting a feature request to ProcessWire. :+1:

We manage these feature requests in this separate repository so that they don’t get mixed up with [bug reports](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-issues/). It also enables us to maintain a collaborative team to help manage them. The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this repository. These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a [pull request](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-requests/pulls).

## Code of conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-requests/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [github@processwire.com](mailto:github@processwire.com).

## Before submitting a feature request

* Please note that we generally avoid adding features that aren’t going to be used by at least 30 % of the ProcessWire audience. Often new features can be better accommodated with modules.
* If we close your feature request, this does not mean it won’t ever be implemented. It just means that we aren’t ready to implement it *just yet*. Closed feature requests aren’t ever deleted, so consider closed feature requests to just be on the back burner.
* Sometimes we will leave a feature request open for awhile to see how much interest it gains from others before we decide whether it should be implemented.
* Please **do not submit bug reports**, instead use the [issues repository](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-issues/).
* Please **do not use this repository for ProcessWire support**, instead use the [support forum](https://processwire.com/talk/).
* **Check the [Wishlist & Roadmap board](https://processwire.com/talk/forum/5-wishlist-roadmap/)** in the forum.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+repo%3Aprocesswire%2Fprocesswire-requests)** to see if the enhancement has already been requested. If it has, add a comment to the existing request instead of opening a new one.

## How to submit a (good) feature request

Always include as many details as possible. There is an [issue template](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-requests/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) which gets used automatically when you create a new feature request. Please use it as it contains all the information needed for a good feature request.

This will help maintainers and the community understand your feature request, comprehend the usefulness of it for the community, and get to a solution more quickly and efficiently.
